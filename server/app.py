You are given food product label and ingredient data. Using the following Yuka-inspired metric, calculate the nutrition scores and additional percentages.

1. Nutritional Benefit Score: Sum the % Daily Value (DV) of beneficial nutrients (fiber, protein, vitamins such as Vitamin D, and minerals like Calcium, Iron, Potassium).
2. Nutritional Risk Score: Sum the % DV of nutrients to limit (total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, added sugars).
3. Overall Nutrition Score: Calculate as (Nutritional Benefit Score) minus (Nutritional Risk Score).
4. Additives Percentage: Estimate the percentage of additives from the ingredient list.
5. Sodium Percentage: Extract the sodium % DV from the label.
6. Health Rating: 
   - Overall Nutrition Score â‰¥ +10 => "High Health Rating"
   - Overall Nutrition Score between 0 and +10 => "Medium Health Rating"
   - Overall Nutrition Score < 0 => "Low Health Rating"

Now, produce a summary that includes:
- Overview: one-sentence explanation of the overall nutritional quality.
- Recommendation: one-sentence recommendation.
- Positive Elements: a comma-separated list of positive nutritional aspects.
- Areas for Improvement: a comma-separated list of aspects that could be improved.

Output Format (exactly 9 lines):
Nutritional Benefit Score: <value>
Nutritional Risk Score: <value>
Overall Nutrition Score: <value> (<Health Rating>)
Additives Percentage: <value>
Sodium Percentage: <value>
Overview: <one-sentence overview>
Recommendation: <one-sentence recommendation>
